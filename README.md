## What is FINd?

FINd produces a 256-bit perceptual hash of an image — two visually
similar images get hashes that are close in Hamming distance (a small
number of bits differ); two unrelated images get hashes that are far
apart (~half the bits differ).

This repository is the consultant's deliverable for the OII SDS in
Practice 2026 summative assignment: benchmark the rough research
implementation, optimise the bottleneck, compare against the leading
open-source library (`imagehash`), and ship as a release-ready Python
library + REST API.

### Use cases

| use case | how FIN customers might apply it |
|---|---|
| **Near-duplicate detection** | Find duplicate uploads in user galleries, catch re-shared memes across platforms, flag visually identical content before storing it twice |
| **Content moderation** | Block re-uploads of previously banned content without storing the original media |
| **Reverse image search** | Find visually similar images in a database without resorting to expensive CNN embeddings or third-party APIs |
| **Cross-platform interoperability** | Share hash databases between platforms without sharing the actual images (privacy-preserving cooperation) |


---

## Quickstart

### Run via Docker 

```bash
docker build -t fin/find .
docker run -d --rm -p 8945:8945 --name fin fin/find

curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8945/compare" \
  -F "image1=@your_image_a.jpg" \
  -F "image2=@your_image_b.jpg"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "image1_hash": "393b246d65a694dc5386279b8e7394f04c9da697877b18a31995ab9893235b65",
  "image2_hash": "18ab6c6f4cae949c591e27998c3394f8588da4d7a74b18a332d6a3d89363db65",
  "distance": 40,
  "confidence": "high",
  "image1_meta": {"width": 250, "height": 250, "size_bytes": 13569},
  "image2_meta": {"width": 250, "height": 250, "size_bytes": 14466},
  "threshold_recommendation": {"high_precision": 75, "balanced": 90, "high_recall": 110}
}
```

Distance < 75 bits → likely duplicate; > 110 bits → likely different.
See `confidence` for an interpreted bucket and `threshold_recommendation`
for cutoffs derived from ROC analysis on the meme_images dataset.

### Run locally without Docker

```bash
pip install -r requirements-api.txt   # runtime-only deps (6 packages)
python -m api                         # starts uvicorn on port 8945
# or: uvicorn api.main:app --port 8945
```

---

## Three usage modes

The same `FINDHasherOptimized` code can be used three ways.

### 1. Python library

```python
from FINd_optimized import FINDHasherOptimized

hasher = FINDHasherOptimized()
hash1 = hasher.fromFile("image_a.jpg")
hash2 = hasher.fromFile("image_b.jpg")
print(f"Distance: {hash1 - hash2} bits out of 256")
```

### 2. Command-line tool

```bash
python FINd_optimized.py --help

python FINd_optimized.py image1.jpg image2.jpg
# 393b246d65a694dc...,image1.jpg
# 18ab6c6f4cae949c...,image2.jpg

python FINd_optimized.py --format json image.jpg
# {"file": "image.jpg", "hash": "393b246d65a694dc..."}

# Pipeline-friendly bare-hash output
python FINd_optimized.py --format hex image.jpg
# 393b246d65a694dc...
```

### 3. HTTP API

```bash
python -m api                              # start server (uvicorn on 8945)
# Then POST to /compare as in the Quickstart above.
# Interactive Swagger UI auto-rendered at: http://localhost:8945/docs
```

## Three implementations — what / why

The repository ships three FINd implementations that should not be
treated as interchangeable. They form a story of refinement:

| file | purpose | when to use |
|---|---|---|
| **`FINd.py`** | The original research implementation provided by FIN. Pure-Python loops; ~464 ms per 250×250 image; **crashes on portrait inputs and silently corrupts on landscape inputs** because of two indexing bugs in `boxFilter` and `findHash256FromFloatLuma`. | Reference baseline for benchmarking only. Do not run in production. |
| **`FINd_fixed.py`** | Two-line bug fix on top of `FINd.py` — corrects the row-major indexing in `boxFilter` (`k*cols+l`) and un-swaps the window-size arguments. Still pure-Python, same ~322 ms runtime. | Reference for correctness — produces semantically valid hashes on non-square inputs. Bit-exact with `FINd.py` on square inputs. |
| **`FINd_optimized.py`** | Numpy-vectorised rewrite of the bottleneck functions (`fillFloatLumaFromBufferImage`, `boxFilter`, `decimateFloat`, `dct64To16`, `dctOutput2hash`). ~5 ms per image (60× faster than baseline, matched conditions). Bit-exact with `FINd_fixed.py` on every real-world image we tested. | **Production**. Drop-in replacement for the reference implementations. |

The bug fix in `FINd_fixed.py` is a no-op on square images (which is
99.998% of the meme_images dataset) so `FINd.py` and `FINd_fixed.py`
produce identical hashes for the realistic workload. We recommend
`FINd_optimized.py` for any new deployment.

## API spec

| method | path | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/compare` | Hash two image uploads and return Hamming distance + extensions |
| `GET`  | `/health`  | Liveness probe (consumed by Docker HEALTHCHECK / Kubernetes) |
| `GET`  | `/version` | Build metadata (`find_version`, `git_sha`, `build_date`) |
| `GET`  | `/docs`    | Interactive Swagger UI auto-generated from Pydantic schemas |

### `POST /compare`

Required fields in the response (`image1_hash`, `image2_hash`,
`distance`) match the assignment brief contract exactly. Additional
fields are optional value-add for downstream consumers; clients that
only need the contract can ignore them.

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `image1_hash` | str (64-char hex) | Required — FINd hash of `image1` |
| `image2_hash` | str (64-char hex) | Required — FINd hash of `image2` |
| `distance` | int (0–256) | Required — Hamming distance between the two hashes |
| `confidence` | "high" / "medium" / "low" | Bucketed from `distance`: `<75` high, `75-110` medium, `≥110` low. Cutoffs calibrated from measured ROC on meme_images (75 ≈ FPR 0.1% / TPR 96%; 110 ≈ FPR 5% / TPR 98%). |
| `image1_meta`, `image2_meta` | `{width, height, size_bytes}` | Per-image metadata for downstream filtering / indexing |
| `threshold_recommendation` | `{high_precision, balanced, high_recall}` | Suggested distance cutoffs for different operating points |

### Validation

Bad inputs return semantic 4xx codes (no `500` from any of the five
categorical bad-input categories — see `tests/test_api.py`):

| condition | code |
|---|---|
| Missing `image1` or `image2` field | 422 |
| Wrong content-type (text file etc.) | 400 |
| Upload exceeds 10 MB | 413 |
| Corrupted / unsupported image format | 400 |
| Zero-dimension or empty image | 400 |

Override the upload limit via env: `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES=20000000`.

## Performance — headline

- **60× faster** than the reference implementation (308 ms → 5.09 ms per
  image, matched-conditions measurement).
- **97.2 % TPR @ 1 % FPR** for near-duplicate detection on
  meme_images — statistically tied with the `imagehash.phash` baseline.
- **API p95 latency 12.95 ms** measured end-to-end via 1000 sequential
  HTTP requests (well under the 100 ms FastAPI usability threshold).
- **419 MB Docker image** (single-stage, slim base, runtime-only deps).

<details>
<summary>📊 Full performance comparison — FINd vs pHash vs wHash (click to expand)</summary>

Measured on Intel i5-1038NG7 @ 2.0 GHz, single core, no GPU,
matched-conditions remeasurement (single session, controlled for the
~30 % run-to-run variance observed on the laptop).

| metric | reference FINd | optimised FINd | pHash (256-bit) | wHash (256-bit) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mean latency** | 308 ms | **5.09 ms** | 1.71 ms | 4.23 ms |
| **p95 via HTTP API** | n/a | **12.95 ms** | n/a | n/a |
| **Throughput single-core** | 3.2 img/s | **197 img/s** | 584 img/s | 236 img/s |
| **Memory peak per request** | 2.1 MiB | **1.5 MiB** | 0.07 MiB | 0.5 MiB |
| **TPR @ FPR=1%** (1000 within / 1000 between meme pairs) | n/a | **97.2 %** | 97.1 % | 96.3 % |
| **AUC ROC** | n/a | 0.9897 | 0.9907 | **0.9921** |
| **Full archive (55 972 imgs)** | 4.78 hours | **4.74 minutes** | ~1.6 minutes | ~3.9 minutes |
| **Cost / 10⁶ images** (AWS Lambda 512 MB) | $2.77 | **$0.24** | $0.21 | $0.32 |
| **Image size (Docker)** | n/a | **419 MB** (slim) | n/a | n/a |

The headline 60× speedup captures **98.6 %** of the theoretical
headroom (5.09 ms vs 0.9 ms upper bound for the unavoidable work — JPEG
decode + thumbnail + numpy luma). Further latency improvements would
require algorithmic change, rejected to preserve bit-exact compatibility
with FIN's existing FINd hash database.

## Tests

65 tests passing in five files:

| file | tests | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/test_hash_stable.py` | 12 | Pinned regression on baseline `FINd.py` |
| `tests/test_bulk_equivalence.py` | 1 | Determinism on 200 random meme images |
| `tests/test_fixed_equivalence.py` | 21 | `FINd_fixed` vs `FINd` — bug fix correctness |
| `tests/test_optimized_equivalence.py` | 21 | `FINd_optimized` vs `FINd_fixed` — bit-exact validation (closes T4) |
| `tests/test_api.py` | 10 | FastAPI HTTP-level — happy path (T6) + 5 bad inputs (T8) + 3 endpoint smoke |

Plus `tests/benchmark_api.py` — 1000-request HTTP latency measurement
(closes T1; not a pytest file, run manually against a live server).

```bash
pytest tests/                              # run all 65 tests (~5 min)
pytest tests/test_optimized_equivalence.py # T4 acceptance only (~40 s)
pytest --cov=. tests/                      # with coverage report
```

## Type safety

`FINd_optimized.py` and the `api/` package are fully type-annotated.
`mypy --ignore-missing-imports` reports **0 type errors across 5 source
files** (the flag is necessary because the `imagehash` third-party
library doesn't ship type stubs — industry-typical for OSS Python
packages).

```bash
pip install mypy
mypy --ignore-missing-imports FINd_optimized.py api/
# Success: no issues found in 5 source files
```

## Privacy warning

⚠️ **Note**: The benchmark dataset (Library of Congress meme generator
collection) **may contain images that some viewers find offensive**.
The dataset is **not redistributed with this repository** — users must
download it separately from the original source if they wish to
reproduce the benchmarks.

The Docker image and Python package never bundle the dataset; only the
hashing algorithm and API service are shipped.

---

## Reproducibility

All measurements in this README and in `private_summative/text.txt`
were taken on:

- **CPU**: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1038NG7 @ 2.00 GHz (4 cores, 8 threads, no GPU)
- **OS**: macOS 26.3 (Darwin 25.3), x86_64
- **Python**: 3.12.12
- **Key libraries**: numpy 2.4.4, Pillow 12.2.0, scipy 1.17.1, fastapi 0.136.1, pydantic 2.13.3, imagehash 4.3.2

Random seeds:
- `BULK_TEST_SEED = 12345` — `test_bulk_*` and `test_optimized_equivalence.test_bulk` (100-image sample from `meme_images`)
- `PROFILE_SUBSET_SEED = 42` — `profile.ipynb` and `accuracy_benchmark.ipynb` (cost cell uses same 100-image subset)
- `ACCURACY_BENCHMARK_SEED = 99` — `accuracy_benchmark.ipynb` stratified within / between pair sampling

Run-to-run latency variance of roughly 30 % was observed on the laptop
(background load + Intel thermal throttling); reported headline
numbers use a matched-conditions remeasurement (all baselines and
optimised version measured in a single session) to control for this.
